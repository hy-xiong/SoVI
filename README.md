# SoVI

This is my archived python 2 code of modeling Social Vulnerability Index with different sample size.

`ACS_Regionalization` is a bascially submodule from https://github.com/geoss/censumander. 
Clone the .py files in the `code` folder from that repo.
__init__.py is left at `ACS_Regionalization` for lib referecing.
